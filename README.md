# Clinical Interface

Currently works on Windows, Mac OS X, and Ubuntu

Requires Python v.3.5

We have provided a Mock PMS system as an example of how to use the practice management API 


# In order to run the Mock PMS System: 
* Navigate to the Middleware Directory
* run `python3 MockPMS.py`

# Files: 
* Middleware/MockPMS.py -- PMS generator. A basic GUI that has text fields where the clinician can enter data. Calls the JsonApp.py file in order to build the GUI.
* Middleware/JsonApp.py -- The GUI code
