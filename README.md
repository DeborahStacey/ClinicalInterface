# Clinical Interface

Currently works on Windows, Mac OS X, and Ubuntu

Requires Python v.2.7

Requires permission. In order to do this for now, run "chmod u+x JsonBuilder.py" after cloning the repo.

# In order to run: 
* ./JsonBuilder.py -- Since this is just the second build, we will manually run this one file like so.

# Files: 
* JsonBuilder.py -- PMS generator. A basic GUI that has text fields where the clinician can enter data. Once submit is clicked, the text in the text field is converted into a JSON object, and hence creates the JSON file.
* interface.py -- Rough GUI of the Clinical Interface
* PMS.py -- JSON extractor.
